title:  "Data Efficient Reinforcement Learning"
layout: multitrack
abstract: "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has seen some spectacular developments
recently. One of the key challenges for many applications facing RL is
data efficiency, i.e., how to learn from limited data. In this workshop
we want to focus on aspects from various disciplines including control,
robotics, personalized healthcare and machine learning, which are
central to progress on data-efficient RL, such as probabilistic methods,
approximation techniques, experimental design, the
exploration/exploitation tradeoff, data efficiency benchmarking and others."
