<p>GUIDED TOUR OF THE PETRITEGI CIDER-HOUSE for all registered participants</p>

A guided tour which will let us approach the “sagardoa” world visiting those
most unknown places. On this tour, you will enjoy a walk around the apple
orchards and you will learn about pollination, the fermentation process,
presses, etc. by watching an audiovisual documentary which illustrates how
natural Petritegi cider has evolved from the 18th century to the present day.

<p>
After the tour, you can get a taste of our cider together with a red sausage “pintxo”.
</p>
<p>
During this visit, children can participate in games and traditional Basque
activities, while adults enjoy the tour.

<p>
We will then enjoy some tapas at the cider house together

(All dishes will be shared in the centre of the table – this is the traditional
way of eating at cider houses)
